  <h1>Seeing Networks in Philadelphia</h1>
  
  <h2><p>Philadelphia’s network infrastructure is messy, clumsy, and often unseen by the general public. Wandering the streets, you may get a vague understanding of what's going on—a manhole cover sits unassumingly on the crosswalk, or maybe a mysterious box with an antenna sits high upon a wall in a back alley, humming into the night. Under your feet and above your eye line, data is soaring by through brightly-lit fiber cable and ethereal radio transmission. The city is alive, but few may ever under stand to what extent.</p>

<p>What follows below is an ever-changing, work-in-progress project to present information about the network infrastructure as it exists within Philadelphia. Readers are encouraged to reach out by emailing <a href="mailto:&#104;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#111;&#64;&#110;&#101;&#116;&#119;&#111;&#114;&#107;&#115;&#111;&#102;&#112;&#104;&#105;&#108;&#108;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#104;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#111;&#64;&#110;&#101;&#116;&#119;&#111;&#114;&#107;&#115;&#111;&#102;&#112;&#104;&#105;&#108;&#108;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a> to share observations, photos, and information that may be suitable for the site.

            <p>PECO, formerly Philadelphia Electric Company, was formed in 1881 to construct and maintain infrastructure to supply electricity to Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs. PECO owns 1,607 miles of high-voltage transmission lines, 15,250 square miles of underground distribution cable, and 12,933 miles of aerial distribution lines. It is currently owned by the Exelon Corporation, and merged with Commonwealth Edison's holding company Unicom Corp in 2000.</p>

            <h2>Keystone Telephone Company</h2>
            <p>Keystone Telephone Company began its existence in 1900 as a direct competitor to Bell Telephone Company. Keystone is often credited as the first phone system in the world with all wires installed via underground conduit. Primarily catering to businesses, Keystone also initially served municipal, fire, and police communications. Bell finally bought out Keystone in 1945, and subsequently retired the company's infrastructure due to redundancies. Keystone Telephone Company manhole covers are still in service, but the conduit is now owned by PECO, where one can assume it is used for electrical cabling.</p>

By 1983, Western Union's international cable system properties were sold to MCI Communications (now owned by Verizon Communications). Western Union sent its last telegram in 2006, but it is unknown whether or not older telegraph lines were pulled out of operation before this time, or if domestic telegraph infrastructure was included in the deal with MCI Communications. The hexagonal pattern on these manholes was a standard for telecommunications at the time; it is often seen today on telephone company manholes.</p>

In 1984, the Bell system (then known as AT&T) was broken into seven "Baby Bell" companies, which led to Philadelphia being serviced by the new Bell Atlantic. In 2000, Bell Atlantic merged with the Connecticut-based GTE Corporation to form Verizon Communications, which still services the city of Philadelphia.</p>

			<p>This handhole is likely used by a provider to deliver cable television services to a a building. While cable television came to Philadelphia in 1983 under three franchises: Comcast, Cablevisions Systems of Philadelphia, and Philadelphia Inner City Cable (with a fourth, Wade Cablevision coming in 1987), Comcast now controls all cable within the city.

    <h1>Street Markings</h1>
    <span id="mark"><h2>Sometimes you'll see a manhole cover that is surrounded with colorful markings. Whenever a contractor or construction company plans to do street excavation, utility companies will mark out the location of their underground cables so that the contractor knows to watch out for them. 
</h2><h2>
There's a federal color-code standard for sidewalk markings. Philadelphia follows that standard.
</h2><h2>
Orange refers to the broad catch-all of "Communications, alarm, signal lines, cables and conduit." This means that orange lines can be internet cables, television cables, telephone lines, or other kinds of conduits. 
</h2><h2>
The markings are sometimes really sloppy, and often in fragments. Sometimes you'll see several different labels in the same place. A lot of these cables are bundled up together running through ducts under the city.

            <h2>Traffic Signal Controllers</h2>
            <p><p>
These dark green signal control boxes attached to traffic signal posts are just one piece of a massive system of networked objects. The system, designed by the North Carolina-based transit services company TransitScore, combines data collected by real-time traffic cameras, RFID (radio frequency identification) scanners, and other field sensors to create traffic signal times that adapt to the immediate conditions of traffic. Each signal control box contains wireless routing equipment and traffic controllers that connect back to a fiber hub. The little green dome on top of the signal control is actually a powerful wireless router used  for communicating with the other sensors in the traffic network and the city’s Traffic Management Center in Long Island City.
</p><p>
This system, initially piloted in 2011 and slowly rolled out to the city’s over 12,500 traffic signals, relies heavily on NYCWiN, the city-wide broadband wireless network project initially created for emergency first responders. Construction of the network began in 2006 under a $500 million contract with defense contractor Northrop Grumman ($20 million of which came from a DHS grant), and the network  became operational in 2009. Many regarded the project as a failure given its limited use (primarily by the Department of Transportation and the Department of Environmental Protection rather than law enforcement) and exorbitant cost (around $40 million annually just to maintain). The city tried to sell the network back to Northrop Grumman in 2011, but the contractor didn’t want it.
</p><p>
Despite NYCWin’s shortcomings supporting law enforcement, their use in the city’s traffic systems has made it fantastically easy to share traffic data with law enforcement rapidly and seamlessly.

The city Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) operate traffic cameras at, respectively, 723 intersections and 20 bridge and tunnel entrances. The DOT cameras have video streams that can be viewed at <a href=http://nyctmc.org>www.nyctmc.org</a>. </p>

            <h2>MTA Cameras</h2>
            <p>It's unclear exactly when the MTA began installing closed-circuit television cameras on some subway platforms, but their efforts to expand that camera network ramped up dramatically after September 11, 2001. The MTA has 4,313 cameras operating throughout the transit system, with 1,576 cameras on city buses. Data collected by cameras feeds back to MTA Rail Control Centers, located in various parts of the city. </p>

            <h2>NYPD Cameras</h2>
            <p>The New York City Police Department has a few thousand labeled surveillance cameras in their Argus program. I don't have an exact number. They wouldn't tell me when I filed a Freedom of Information request because having a list of all the camera locations would encourage crime. As this is not a field guide to the labyrinth of insanity that is NYPD's FOIL policies, perhaps we should not discuss the matter further. </p>

    <h1>Sightseeing</h1>
    <span id="mark"><h2>There are few well-known locations that people tend to go to when they want to "see the Internet" in Philadelphia. Identifying these buildings when looking on the street is not always easy, but one telltale sign is to look for signs of ventilation and cooling systems. Alternatively, look for windows, or more accurately, the absence of them. (Note: on much larger buildings, in particular skyscrapers, vents also could just be a sign of a mechanical floor, the centralized space dedicated to maintaining utility needs for the entire building.)
</h2><h2>
New infrastructures have a tendency to inherit the homes of past infrastructures, and the Internet is no exception. Many of the major Internet exchanges and data centers of Manhattan are in buildings that used to be telegraph switches, telephone company headquarters, and other industrial spaces. While this is by no means an exhaustive list, these are a few interesting starting points from which you can start looking for cable markings, cameras, or other signs of Internet infrastructure. </h2></span>
