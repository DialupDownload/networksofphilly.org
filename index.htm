  <h1>Seeing Networks in Philadelphia</h1>
  
  <h2><p>Philadelphia’s network infrastructure is messy, clumsy, and often unseen by the general public. Wandering the streets, you may get a vague understanding of what's going on—a manhole cover sits unassumingly on the crosswalk, or maybe a mysterious box with an antenna sits high upon a wall in a back alley, humming into the night. Under your feet and above your eye line, data is soaring by through brightly-lit fiber cable and ethereal radio transmission. The city is alive, but few may ever under stand to what extent.</p>

<p>What follows below is an ever-changing, work-in-progress project to present information about the network infrastructure as it exists within Philadelphia. Readers are encouraged to reach out by emailing <a href="mailto:&#104;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#111;&#64;&#110;&#101;&#116;&#119;&#111;&#114;&#107;&#115;&#111;&#102;&#112;&#104;&#105;&#108;&#108;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#104;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#111;&#64;&#110;&#101;&#116;&#119;&#111;&#114;&#107;&#115;&#111;&#102;&#112;&#104;&#105;&#108;&#108;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a> to share observations, photos, and information that may be suitable for the site.

            <h2>PECO</h2>
            <p>PECO, formerly Philadelphia Electric Company, was formed in 1881 to construct and maintain infrastructure to supply electricity to Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs. PECO owns 1,607 miles of high-voltage transmission lines, 15,250 square miles of underground distribution cable, and 12,933 miles of aerial distribution lines. It is currently owned by the Exelon Corporation, and merged with Commonweath Edison's holding company Unicom Corp in 2000.</p>

            <h2>Keystone Telephone Company</h2>
            <p>Keystone Telephone Company began its existence in 1900 as a direct competitor to Bell Telephone Company. Keystone is often credited as the first phone system in the world with all wires installed via underground conduit. Primarily catering to businesses, Keystone also initially served municipal, fire, and police communications. Bell finally bought out Keystone in 1945, and subsequently retired the company's infrastructure due to redundancies. Keystone Telephone Company manhole covers are still in service, but the conduit is now owned by PECO, where one can assume it is used for electrical cabling.</p>

            <h2>Western Union Telegraph Company</h2>
            <p>Western Union began operation in 1851, quickly creating a vast telegraph network across the United States. By 1983, Western Union's international cable system properties were sold to MCI Communications (now owned by Verizon Communications). Western Union sent its last telegram in 2006, but it is unknown whether or not older telegraph lines were pulled out of operation before this time, or if domestic telegraph infrastructure was included in the deal with MCI Communications. The hexagonal pattern on these manholes was standard for communications at the time; it is otwen seen today on telephone company manholes.</p>

            <h2>Bell Telephone Company</h2>
            <p>Bell Telephone began as a company in 1879, and started operating Philadelphia within the same year. In 1984, the Bell system (then known as AT&T) was broken into seven "Baby Bell" companies, which led to Philadelphia being serviced by the new Bell Atlantic. In 2000, Bell Atlantic merged with the Connecticut-based GTE Corporation to form Verizon Communications, which still services the city of Philadelphia.</p>

            <h2>Metromedia Fiber Network</h2>
            <p>Originally launched in 1993 as National Fiber Network, Metromedia focused on running dark fiber to communications carriers in the U.S. and Europe. The  company filed for bankruptcy in 2002, though it re-emerged in 2003 under the name Abovenet. In 2007, the company acquired fiver from AT&T and Verizon that was being sold to comply with antitrust law. The infrastructure is currently owned by the Zayo Group.</p>

This included telegraph and telephone traffic between departments and their buildings. The Electrical Bureau was abolished in 1951, though its responsibilities are now transferred to the Communications group within the Department of Public Property.</p>

They are a major Tier 1 network, which means that their network has a direct connection to every other network online without paying fees to do so. In 2012, Level 3 received a $411 million contract from the Department of Defense's Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to provide fiber cable and maintenance support to DoD networks.

    <span id="mark"><h2>Sometimes you'll see a manhole cover that is surrounded with colorful markings. Whenever a contractor or construction company plans to do street excavation, utility companies will mark out the location of their underground cables so that the contractor knows to watch out for them. 
</h2><h2>
There's a federal color-code standard for sidewalk markings. New York follows that standard.

Orange refers to the broad catch-all of "Communications, alarm, signal lines, cables and conduit." This means that orange lines can be internet cables, television cables, telephone lines, or other kinds of conduits. 

The markings are sometimes really sloppy, and often in fragments. Sometimes you'll see several different labels in the same place. A lot of these cables are bundled up together running through ducts under the city. </h2></span>

Though AT&T doesn't have as strong of a presence within the city anymore, they still maintain a Central Office building at <b>500 S 27th St.</b> (right by the South Street bridge) that is presumably used for continued AT&T long lines service and collocation for other telephone companies.</p>

            <p>RCN is an internet service provider and a television cable provider. They're the 10th-largest ISP in the country. It is unclear if a cable marked "RCN" is actually a cable that belongs to RCN because of some mergers & acquisitions dark magic that happened over the last few years. Currently, RCN has a franchise agreement with the city as an "open video system". This is different from a cable provider, but the franchise agreements are pretty similar. In 2001, Con Edison announced that they were creating their own fiber optic network, managed by the holding company Con Edison Communications. In 2006, RCN acquired Con Edison Communications for $32 million. RCN was acquired by private equity firm Abry Partners in 2010, which repackaged and rebranded its metro area operations (which managed the former Con Ed fiber network) as Sidera Networks. Sidera merged with Lightower Networks in 2013, after both companies were acquired by Berkshire Partners in 2012. </p>

And lots of things can run over fiber-VoIP, television, and the internet can all run over fiber cables. In general, where you see telephone cables, you'll also see other kinds of cables, including fiber. </p>

            <h2>Traffic Signal Controllers</h2>
            <p><p>
These dark green signal control boxes attached to traffic signal posts are just one piece of a massive system of networked objects. The system, designed by the North Carolina-based transit services company TransitScore, combines data collected by real-time traffic cameras, RFID (radio frequency identification) scanners, and other field sensors to create traffic signal times that adapt to the immediate conditions of traffic. Each signal control box contains wireless routing equipment and traffic controllers that connect back to a fiber hub. The little green dome on top of the signal control is actually a powerful wireless router used  for communicating with the other sensors in the traffic network and the city’s Traffic Management Center in Long Island City.
</p><p>
This system, initially piloted in 2011 and slowly rolled out to the city’s over 12,500 traffic signals, relies heavily on NYCWiN, the city-wide broadband wireless network project initially created for emergency first responders. Construction of the network began in 2006 under a $500 million contract with defense contractor Northrop Grumman ($20 million of which came from a DHS grant), and the network  became operational in 2009. Many regarded the project as a failure given its limited use (primarily by the Department of Transportation and the Department of Environmental Protection rather than law enforcement) and exorbitant cost (around $40 million annually just to maintain). The city tried to sell the network back to Northrop Grumman in 2011, but the contractor didn’t want it.
</p><p>
Despite NYCWin’s shortcomings supporting law enforcement, their use in the city’s traffic systems has made it fantastically easy to share traffic data with law enforcement rapidly and seamlessly.

            <h2>Distributed Antenna Systems</h2>
            <p>A Distributed Antenna System (DAS) is basically a way to expand a cell network's reach, adding capacity in under-covered areas. They're a little easier to find on the street because they're not on top of buildings--they're attached to street poles and linked to underground fiber-optic networks. If you ever see an orange cable marking going into a street pole, look up. You'll probably see a DAS. There are 7 companies with franchise agreements to maintain Distributed Antenna Systems in New York; however, 3 of those companies appear to belong to one company (Crown Castle) and 2 appear to be subsidiaries of the same company (ExteNet Systems). </p>

            <p>In 2007, the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) began working with contractor Transit Wireless on building out a fiber-optic network to support wifi access on subway platforms. The system works similarly to a DAS--signals from wireless carrier base stations are converted by Transit Wireless into optical signals, which are sent to RF nodes in individual stations. The RF node then distributes that signal to antennae in the station. The pilot program began trials in 2011. As of summer 2014, 47 of the city's 278 stations had wifi access.

            <p>If you're connecting to the internet when you're out in the world, you're probably connecting to a cellular wireless network. Seeing the internet on the street, for many, just means using a smartphone. Those phones connect to networks via cell towers. Generally, these are pretty hard to see from the street--they're mostly on tops of buildings. They're also often disguised, although their New York disguises (bricks on buildings) are pretty simple compared to cell tower disguises in other places (trees, church crosses, cacti). </p>

    <span id="mark"><h2>Admittedly, much of this guide has focused on seeing internet-connected networks in the field--networks that, for the most part, the reader has access to. But the city is also full of networked objects that, while often serving a public interest, aren't connected to public networks. These sensors vary from monitoring vehicular traffic to recording water usage. Surveillance cameras are perhaps one of the more noticeable--and contested--forms of networked objects in public space. The public "connects" to surveillance networks all the time, albeit involuntarily, and this section offers a view into who controls some of the ubiquitous networks.

    <span id="mark"><h2>There are a few well-known locations that people tend to go to when they want to "see the internet" in New York. Of course, there are plenty of not-so-famous buildings in Manhattan that store lots of data and connect networks to each other. Identifying these buildings when looking on the street is not always easy, but one telltale sign is to look for signs of ventilation and cooling systems. Alternatively, look for windows, or more accurately, the absence of them. (Note: on much larger buildings, in particular skyscrapers, vents also could just be a sign of a mechanical floor, the centralized space dedicated to maintaining utility needs for the entire building.)
</h2><h2>
New infrastructures have a tendency to inherit the homes of past infrastructures, and the internet is no exception. Many of the major internet exchanges and data centers of Manhattan are in buildings that used to be telegraph switches, telephone company headquarters, and other industrial spaces. While this is by no means an exhaustive list, these are a few interesting starting points from which you can start looking for cable markings, cameras, or other signs of internet infrastructure. </h2></span>

            <p>Built in 1932 to be a Port Authority warehouse/transport center and later Port Authority offices, 111 Eighth Avenue was turned into a carrier hotel in 1998 by Taconic Investment Partners. In 2010, Google purchased the building for nearly $2 billion. While Google uses a majority of the building for its own office space, the carrier hotel and a number of ISPs, startups, and ground-level retail remains.

As of this writing, there are a lot of orange cable markings extending from and going into the area around 111 Eighth Avenue. Its neighborhood footprint extends to the west, with office space in nearby Chelsea Market (also home to the NYPD Intelligence Division) and 85 Tenth Avenue (home to the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force and a Level 3 Communications colocation center). Defense contractor Palantir recently acquired space nearby on 15th Street. This is just kind of cool to know I guess.</p>

            <h2>32 Avenue of the Americas</h2>
            <p>Similar to 60 Hudson and 111 Eighth Avenue, 32 Avenue of the Americas is yet another building whose old infrastructure has been reappropriated by internet infrastructure. Built in 1932, 32 Avenue of the Americas was originally the AT&T Long Distance Building. In 1999 Rudin Management, a major New York real estate firm, purchased the building and turned into a carrier hotel. Designed by the same architecture firm that created 60 Hudson (Voorhees, Gmelin and Walker), 32 Avenue of the Americas is a similarly impressive Deco building. Highly recommend the mural in the lobby dedicated to the magic of telephony.

            <h2>375 Pearl Street</h2>
            <p>Relatively younger and decidedly less Deco than other major connection points in Manhattan, 375 Pearl was build in 1975 as a switching station by the New York Telephone Company. Taconic Investment Partners (the same company that turned 111 Eighth Avenue into a carrier hotel) purchased the building in 2007, with grandiose plans to transform its much-derided windowless exterior and add new office space and condominiums. The economic collapse of 2008 pretty much killed that plan and 275 Pearl ended up being sold at a massive loss to Sabey Data Center Properties in 2011 (Verizon still uses some floors of the building). Sabey rechristened the building Intergate Manhattan, describing it in publicity materials as "the world's tallest data center."
</p><p>
Like 111 Eighth Avenue, 375 Pearl is made more remarkable in part by what's around it, or more specifically what surrounds it: as its next-door neighbor is NYPD headquarters 1 Police Plaza, the building has police checkpoints on pretty much every side. For a more detailed history and context of 375 Pearl check out Lance Wakeling's film "Views of a Former Verizon Building" online at <a href="http://privatecirculation.com">privatecirculation.com</a>.</p>
