# README

This is the Networks of Philly site, located at [networksofphilly.org](https://networksofphilly.org).

It is currently just HTML/CSS/JS, and cloned from [seeingnetworks.in](http://seeingnetworks.in). They might actually be using a static site generator, but I just wget'd the site, made all of the resources local, and made some style tweaks.

## Run Your Own Local Copy

Very easy to do, just clone this repo and load it in a browser.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/networksofphilly/networksofphilly.org.git
```

Chrome complains and breaks things if you open `index.htm` up, which is probably due to javascript security standards, but Firefox will render things just fine. Or, you could just cp the repo to a live web server, that works well :)

## Submit Your Own/Updates

If you are reading this and have something cool to share, you are invited to make updates to the site. I'm sure I got something wrong, and there is a lot of stuff out there I have not seen. I want to hear from you!

Updates can be submitted to the site through standard GitHub [pull requests](https://github.com/networksofphilly/networksofphilly.org/pulls). If that is too technical or you just want to discuss the possibility of including something new or fixing a mistake, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/networksofphilly/networksofphilly.org/issues)!
